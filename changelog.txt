-- Changelog --
Legend:
  @: optimization
  +: new feature
  #: bug fix
  -: removed feature
  *: note

v.1.4.1-beta:
  +: SDK now depends on libz.dylib.
  +: Automatic background sensor calibration. Required time and device movement for reaching full
     calibration has been greatly reduced. See, <IndoorAtlasBackgroundCalbrator>
  +: Because calibration is maintained continuously, positioning can be started immediately
     without an initial calibration movement.
  +: Added width and height properties to IndoorAtlasFloorplan.
  -: Image format string from "fetchFloorplanImage:" completion block was removed.
  -: Removed explicit calibration.
  -: Removed deprecated background calibrator API methods.
  #: Added libicucore.dylib to the getting started guide.
  #: Internal bug fixes.

v1.3.0-beta:
  +: Introduce connect, prepare, prepareWithParameters, startWithParameters
     methods to IndoorAtlasPositioner.
  +: IndoorAtlasPositioner now exposes more state.
     'connecting', 'connected', 'loading', 'ready', 'waitingForFix'
  +: Introduce calibrateUsingBackgroundCalibrator method to
     IndoorAtlasCalibrator. Use this method to get similar calibration as in
     IndoorAtlas Appstore application 'First Calibration' view.
  +: Added possibility to submit explicit position.
  *: Implementing background calibrator delegate will now emit StateChanged:
     method immediately.
  *: Changed background calibrator API, update your delegate implementations
     to use the new method "indoorAtlasBackgroundCalibratorStateChanged:".
  *: Renamed kIndoorAtlasErrorCalibrationValidation ->
     kIndoorAtlasErrorCalibrationFailed
  *: Renamed kIndoorAtlasErrorCouldNotGetLocationFix ->
     kIndoorAtlasErrorCouldNotGetPosition
  -: needsCalibration was deprecated in favor of calibrationStatus.
  -: Removed probability from the API, use radius parameter instead in
     IndoorAtlasPosition.

v1.1.1-beta:
  +: Added possibility to get center geocoordinate of floorplan.
  #: Fixed bug where positioner sent IndoorAtlasPosition instances with only
     longitudinal coordinates.

v1.1.0-beta:
  +: Websocket communication.
  +: Added IndoorAtlasFetch protocol.
  +: Added progress blocks for some fetch methods.
  +: Added background calibrator protocol.
