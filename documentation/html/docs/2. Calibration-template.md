# Calibration

Proper device calibration is essential for good indoor positioning accuracy.
IndoorAtlas SDK provides automatic background calibration which allows small movements of device to help positioning accuracy.

You can implement <IndoorAtlasBackgroundCalibratorDelegate> to query information about the calibration state.

```
- (void)indoorAtlasBackgroundCalibratorStateChanged:(IndoorAtlasBackgroundCalibratorState)state
{
    switch (state) {
        case kIndoorAtlasBackgroundCalibratorStatusRunning:
            NSLog(@"Background calibration is running.");
            break;

        case kIndoorAtlasBackgroundCalibratorStatusStopped:
            NSLog(@"Background calibration stopped.");
            break;
    }
}

- (void)indoorAtlasBackgroundCalibratorQualityChanged:(IndoorAtlasCalibrationQuality)quality
{
    switch (quality) {
        case kIndoorAtlasCalibrationQualityExcellent:
            NSLog(@"Calibratin quality is excellent.");
            break;

        case kIndoorAtlasCalibrationQualityOk:
            NSLog(@"Calibratin quality is ok.");
            break;

        case kIndoorAtlasCalibrationQualityPoor:
            NSLog(@"Calibratin quality is poor.");
            break;
    }
}
```

It is good idea to show indication on user interface when the calibration quality is poor and instruct user to move the device slightly.
